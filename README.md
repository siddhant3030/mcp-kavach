*Kavach* (कवच) means **armor**. You type your email into a Claude session, or an
MCP tool dumps warehouse rows with phone numbers into the model's context —
and that data is now in a third-party prompt log. kavach sits at every door
and asks first.

## 🚀 Quick start: Claude Code in 60 seconds

```bash
uv tool install mcp-kavach        # or: pip install mcp-kavach
```

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add siddhant3030/mcp-kavach
/plugin install kavach@kavach
```

Now try it — type a prompt with an email in it:

```
> my email is sid@example.org, write me a signature

⛔ kavach blocked this prompt — it contains EMAIL (s***@example.org).

   Masked version you can copy:
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ my email is s***@example.org, write me a signature │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   To send the original anyway, resend the exact same message within 5 minutes.
```

Three guards ship enabled:

| Guard | Where | Default behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 🛑 **Prompt guard** | your messages | block + masked copy + confirm-by-resend |
| ❓ **Tool-input guard** | MCP / Bash / WebFetch calls | native "share this anyway?" dialog |
| 📢 **Tool-output detector** | MCP results | warning + hash-only audit (mask via [`kavach proxy`](#-mask-mcp-tool-outputs-with-the-proxy)) |

Everything is configurable per-guard (`ask` / `mask` / `warn` / `off`) — see
[docs/claude-plugin.md](docs/claude-plugin.md). No `kavach` CLI installed →
the plugin stays silent and never breaks your session.

## 🛡️ Mask MCP tool *outputs* with the proxy

Claude Code hooks can't rewrite a tool result, so kavach ships an MCP gateway:
wrap any server you can't modify, tools are mirrored 1:1, and every result is
scrubbed before the model sees it.

```bash
uv tool install 'mcp-kavach[proxy]'       # the proxy extra pulls in fastmcp
```

**1. Move your real server into an upstreams file** — `~/.kavach/upstreams.json`,
the standard `.mcp.json` shape (env vars carry over unchanged):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warehouse": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/warehouse-mcp", "warehouse-mcp"],
      "env": { "WAREHOUSE_API_URL": "http://localhost:8002" }
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Point your MCP client at the proxy instead** — Claude Code's `.mcp.json`,
Cursor, or any other client. Keep the same server key: with a single upstream,
tools are mirrored 1:1 under their original names, so nothing else about your
setup changes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warehouse": {
      "command": "kavach",
      "args": ["proxy",
               "--config", "/Users/you/.kavach/upstreams.json",
               "--policy", "ngo-default",
               "--audit", "/Users/you/.local/share/kavach/audit.jsonl"]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Restart your session.** Every tool result now passes through the policy
before the model sees it:

```
tool returns                              model sees
{"name": "Lakshmi Devi",          →       {"name": "[MASKED:PERSON_NAME]",
 "phone": "+91 98765 43210",      →        "phone": "+** ***** *3210",
 "aadhaar": "2345 6789 0124",     →        "aadhaar": "[BLOCKED:ngo-default/govt-financial-block]",
 "village": "Rampur"}             →        "village": "Rampur"}
```

The model still reasons fine — counts, dates, villages intact. The person
doesn't leak. With multiple upstreams in one config, tools are prefixed
`{server}_{tool}` — mind your policy tool globs.

## 🐳 Docker

The proxy also ships as a container — useful when you'd rather not install
Python tooling on the host, or want the guardrail pinned in CI:

```bash
docker build -t kavach .
docker run -i --rm -v ~/.kavach:/config kavach \
  proxy --config /config/upstreams.json --policy ngo-default
```

Or point your MCP client straight at the container (releases publish
`ghcr.io/siddhant3030/mcp-kavach`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warehouse": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "/Users/you/.kavach:/config",
               "ghcr.io/siddhant3030/mcp-kavach",
               "proxy", "--config", "/config/upstreams.json", "--policy", "ngo-default"]
    }
  }
}
```

`-i` matters: stdio is the MCP protocol channel. One caveat — upstream servers
defined as *commands* must exist inside the container, so either derive an image
that installs them (`FROM ghcr.io/siddhant3030/mcp-kavach` + your server) or use
URL-based upstreams.

## 🔍 What it detects

| Entity | Validation |
|---|---|
| EMAIL | format |
| PHONE (India + international) | digit boundaries |
| CREDIT_CARD | **Luhn checksum** |
| IP_ADDRESS | octet range |
| AADHAAR 🇮🇳 | **Verhoeff checksum** |
| PAN 🇮🇳 | holder-type check |
| IFSC 🇮🇳 | format |
| AWS / GitHub / JWT secrets | anchored formats |
| PERSON_NAME, ADDRESS, DOB, BANK_ACCOUNT, GOVT_ID | column-name heuristics (structured data) |

Checksums kill most false positives (a random 12-digit number is rejected
unless it passes Verhoeff). Try it:

```bash
$ kavach scan "call me at 9876543210 or lakshmi@example.org"
call me at ******3210 or l***@example.org

ENTITY           ACTION        RULE                     TIER CONF
PHONE            partial_mask  contact-partial          1    0.90
EMAIL            partial_mask  contact-partial          1    0.95
```

## 📜 Policies are YAML, not code

```yaml
name: my-org
defaults:
  unknown_entity_action: mask        # fail closed
rules:
  - id: contact-partial
    entities: [EMAIL, PHONE]
    action: partial_mask             # l***@example.org, ******3210
  - id: ids-block
    entities: [AADHAAR, PAN, CREDIT_CARD]
    action: block
    message: "Government/financial IDs don't go to the model. Org policy."
  - id: notes-redact
    match: { tool: "get_beneficiar*", json_path: "$.rows[*].notes" }
    action: redact                   # structural rule — zero text scanning
```

Actions `allow | partial_mask | mask | redact | block`, first-match-wins,
`scope: result` refuses a whole payload. Seven shipped presets: `personal`
(plugin default), `ngo-default`, `strict`, `dev`, plus draft regulation packs
`dpdp`, `gdpr`, `hipaa-lite` ([docs/policy-packs.md](docs/policy-packs.md)).
Reference: [docs/policy-schema.md](docs/policy-schema.md).

## 🧾 Audit you can show your auditor

Every detection is logged with entity type, detector tier, confidence, the
rule that fired, JSON path, offsets — and a **salted HMAC instead of the
value**. The log is safe to show to anyone cleared to see the redacted
output. *"Which categories of personal data left our infrastructure toward a
model provider this quarter?"* is one query. `/kavach:status` summarizes it
inside Claude Code.

## 🗺️ Where kavach sits

Of the four agent-guardrail stages — data collection, model training,
**agent tools & actions**, prompt/response — kavach owns stage 3 at the MCP
protocol layer, where structured tool traffic actually exists. LLM gateways
(Portkey, Kong) guard stage 4; nothing open-source guarded stage 3. Built for
sovereignty-sensitive deployments (NGOs under India's DPDP Act): fully
self-hosted, no vendor vault, no SaaS calls, every dependency permissive OSS.

## ⚠️ Honest limitations (v0.2)

- **No NER yet** — free-text names/addresses are caught only via column-name
  heuristics; a name inside a paragraph gets through. India-tuned NER is the
  next milestone. Don't let regex create false confidence.
- Prompt guard can't *rewrite* prompts (Claude Code hook limitation) — it
  blocks and hands you the masked copy.
- Tool-output hook can't *unsend* — it warns; true masking needs the proxy.
- Checksums shrink false positives, can't zero them; confidence is never 1.0.
- Protects against **accidental** exposure, not malicious servers or prompt
  injection: [docs/threat-model.md](docs/threat-model.md).

## 🐍 Library use (any Python agent, 3 lines)

```bash
uv add mcp-kavach        # or: pip install mcp-kavach
```

```python
from mcp_kavach import Engine, load_preset

engine = Engine(load_preset("ngo-default"))
result = engine.scan_result("get_beneficiaries", rows)   # masked payload + audit events
```
